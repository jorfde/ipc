## IPC Project

This is one of the final projects for our Human-Computer Interfaces class in sophomore year at UPV. We created an application to manage patients, doctors and appointments in a hospital. 

If you just want to run the app, go to the  ``dist_copy`` folder and just double-click ``ManagementApplication.jar`` after cloning or downloading the project.

* To add patients
* To delete patients
* To view patients' details
* To add doctors
* To delete doctors
* To view doctors' details
* To add appointments
* To delete appointments
* To view appointment details
