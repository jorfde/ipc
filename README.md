## IPC Project

This is one of the final projects for our Human-Computer Interfaces class. We created an application to manage patients, doctors and appointments in a hospital. 

If you just want to run the app, go to the  ``dist `` folder and just double-click ``ManagementApplication.jar`` after cloning or downloading the project.

* To add doctors
