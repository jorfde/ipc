This is one of the final projects for our Human-Computer Interfaces class. We created an application to manage patients, doctors and appointments in a hospital. The program provides a GUI that allows:

* To add patients
* To delete patients
* To view patients' details
* To add doctors
* To delete doctors
* To view doctors' details
* To add appointments
* To delete appointments
* To view appointment details
